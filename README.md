# SQL Database Design and Query Practice

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts focused on **database design, relationship modeling, and query operations**. The scripts demonstrate how to create structured databases, define relationships between entities, and perform meaningful data queries using SQL.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Creation
- Created multiple databases, each representing a small system or use case.
- Each database contains **two or more related tables**.
- Tables were designed with appropriate columns and data types.

---

### 2. Table Relationships
- Established relationships between tables using **primary keys and foreign keys**.
- Modeled **one-to-many relationships** between entities.
- Ensured data integrity across related tables.

---

### 3. SQL Joins
- Performed **INNER JOINs** to retrieve matching records across tables.
- Used **LEFT JOINs** to include all records from a primary table with related data where available.
- Demonstrated how joins are used to answer real-world business questions.

---

### 4. Views
- Created **SQL views** to simplify complex queries.
- Used views to represent frequently accessed or aggregated data.
- Improved query readability and reusability.

---

### 5. Logical Data Modeling
- Designed and implemented **logical data models** using SQL scripts.
- Defined entity structures and relationships before querying.
- Applied best practices for relational database design.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- GitHub for version control

---

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A learning exercise in **relational database design**
- A demonstration of **SQL querying and modeling skills**
- A portfolio reference for data analyst and database-related roles
